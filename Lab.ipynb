    "This was a brief introduction into TensorFlow. There is so, so much more to learn and explore, but hopefully this has given you some base knowledge to expand upon. As an additional exercise, you can see what you can do with this code to improve the performance. Ideas include: randomizing mini-batches, making the network deeper, using word embeddings (see below) rather than bag-of-words, trying different optimizers (like Adam), different weight initializations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### More on Word Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we used one-hot vectors to represent words in tweets.  Word Embeddings are a more meaningful representation.  The basic idea is we represent a word with a vector $\\phi$ by the context the word appears in. We do this by training a neural network to predict the context of words across a large training set. The weights of that neural network can then be thought of as a dense and useful representation that captures context. This is useful because now our representations of words captures actual semantic similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word Embeddings capture all kinds of useful semantic relationships. For example, one cool emergent property is $ \\phi(king) - \\phi(queen) = \\phi(man) - \\phi(woman)$. To learn more about the magic behind word embeddings we recommend Chris Olah's [blog post](https://colah.github.io/posts/2014-07-NLP-RNNs-Representations/). A common tool for generating Word Embeddings is word2vec."
